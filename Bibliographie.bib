	abstract = {The impact of non-native plant invasions on ecosystems has been controversial because obvious local effects have not yet led to the global extinction of any native plant species on continents and large islands. We suggest that extinction is not the appropriate measure of impact on ecosystem function and present evidence that non-native plant invasions or the replacement of native plants with non-native ornamentals results in significant bottom-up reductions of energy available for local food webs. Using replicated common gardens we compared Lepidoptera species richness and abundance on native plants, non-native congeners of those natives, and non-native species with no close relatives in the study area. Non-native plants supported significantly fewer caterpillars of significantly fewer specialist and generalist species even when the non-natives were close relatives of native host plants. However, the effect size was smaller in the latter category indicating phylogenetic similarity to local natives may positively impact herbivory. Cluster analysis revealed that a non-native plant congener often supports a lepidopteran community that is a subset of the similar, but more diverse community found on its native congener. The proportion of the Lepidoptera community consisting of specialist species was about five times larger across native species within sites compared to non-native plant species. In addition, species accumulation trajectories suggested that in a fully sampled community the differences between the Lepidoptera supported by native and non-native plants may be even greater than presented here.},

	abstract = {One of the most significant challenges to insect conservation is lack of information concerning species diversity and distribution. Because a complete inventory of all species in an area is virtually impossible, interest has turned to developing statistical techniques to guide sampling design and to estimate total species richness within a site. We used two such techniques, diversity partitioning and non-parametric richness estimation, to determine how variation in sampling effort over time affected species accumulation for a survey of Lepidoptera in an old-growth beech-maple forest. Temporal scaling of sampling effort had significant effects on two measures of species diversity. Increases in species richness were primarily driven by changes in species occurrences with season, while Shannon diversity was largely determined at the scale of individual sampling units (i.e. by spatial effects). Variation in sampling effort affected the values of the two most widely regarded richness estimators (ICE and Chao 2); neither diversity estimator achieved stable values across a range of sampling efforts. Even after 52 trap-nights and accounting for seasonality, rare species (singletons and uniques) remained a significant component of the moth community. To the extent that moth communities in other forest systems are similarly comprised of many rare species, non-parametric richness estimators should be expected to yield variable estimates with increased effort and should only be used to provide a minimum benchmark for predicting the number of species remaining to be sampled. Our results suggest the best strategy for a short-term survey of forest Lepidoptera should emphasize spreading sampling intervals throughout a given year rather than focusing on intensive sampling during a short time period or prolonged sampling over many years.},

	abstract = {Context
Urbanization and landscape homogenization are main drivers causing biodiversity loss across the globe. The transformation of natural and semi-natural habitats into agro-environments and settlement areas causes the reduction of species diversity, and thus faunal homogenization.
Objective
In this study, we analyse changes in land-cover and habitat configuration and test for changes in species richness and community composition of butterflies in an urban area and a nature reserve.
Method
We analysed historical and recent aerial and satellite pictures, and studied the butterfly fauna for two areas in northern Austria, the urban area around Salzburg city and the nature reserve Bluntautal in close geographic proximity. For these analyses we consider the period 1946–2018.
Results
The proportion of settlement area and forest increased in average by about 5\%. Size of field copses increased and small-scale connectivity and thus landscape complexity decreased in both areas. In the same time span, we found a decrease in butterfly species richness for both areas, and in the nature reserve Bluntautal particularly for the past two decades by 50\%. The species community composition changed significantly, with severe losses of specialist and xerothermophilic species which rely on open and extensively used ecosystems.
Conclusions
The findings underpin that the reduction of landscape complexity and the intensification of land-use including urbanization drives the loss of diversity of butterflies and changes in species composition, today dominated by some few generalist species. This trend is particularly observable for the nature reserve Bluntautal, where a large proportion of species diversity has disappeared in recent years despite nature conservation. This case underlines habitat management in nature reserves is needed to hold a high level of habitat quality and to preserve the entire species diversity.},

	abstract = {We review the existing literature on patterns of moth (Lepidoptera) species richness and community composition in northeastern Nearctic forest ecosystems across hierarchical scales ranging from individual trees to entire managed ecoregions. Moths are species-rich in northeastern forests of North America, with the most diverse families being Noctuidae and Geometridae. Individual trees and forest stands, however, are often dominated by few species. Climate, stand age, disturbance regime, and landscape heterogeneity are significant predictors of abundance of dominant species. Most other moth species in the regional pool are patchily distributed and appear to occur regularly at very low abundance. Moth communities respond predictably to forest-management practices, and the outcomes of postmanagement response are largely driven by changes in the plant community. Significant reductions in moth species richness and changes in community composition are correlated with clear-cut harvesting, whereas selective logging appears to cause more moderate changes in moth community structure. Broad-scale effects of forest fragmentation on moth communities in unglaciated regions are best described by species replacement rather than species loss; moth species richness decreases slightly across a gradient of fragment sizes, but shifts in moth community composition are more important, especially in the relative importance of herbaceous-plant-feeding species in large and small fragments. Species that appear to be most sensitive to timber management or habitat loss are dietary specialists as larvae, dispersal-limited as adults, or dependent on commercially valuable tree species such as oaks, Quercus L. (Fagaceae). Restored forest stands tend to converge in terms of lepidopteran species dominance and diversity among stands, suggesting that the long-term consequences of timber management or habitat loss include a significant reduction of regional β-diversity. Finally, future research on forest Lepidoptera should include an emphasis on understanding the role of urban woodland habitat in retaining viable and diverse moth communities and how the spatial pattern of timber harvest affects the relative magnitude of α- and β-diversity components within a given ecoregion.},

	abstract = {Rapoport’s rule proposes that a species’ range size increases with the increase in a gradient (such as latitude, altitude or water depth). However, altitudinal distributions and Rapoport’s rule have rarely been tested for Asian Lepidoptera. Pyraustinae and Spilomelinae (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) are extremely diverse in temperate Asia, including on Mount Taibai, which is considered a hotspot area for studying the vertical distribution patterns of insect species. Based on the investigation of altitudinal distribution data with identification by using both DNA barcoding and the morphological classification of Pyraustinae and Spilomelinae, this paper determines the altitudinal gradient pattern for these two subfamilies on the north slope of Mount Taibai, and provides a test of the universality of Rapoport’s rule in Lepidoptera by using four methods, including Stevens’ method, Pagel’s method, Rohde’s method, and the cross-species method. Our results show that the alpha diversity of Pyraustinae and Spilomelinae both decrease with rising altitude. By contrast, the species’ ranges increase with rising altitude. Three of the four methods used to test Rapoport’s rule yielded positive results, while Rohde’s results show a unimodal distribution model and do not support Rapoport’s rule. Our findings fill the research gap on the elevational diversity of Lepidoptera in temperate Asia.},

	abstract = {Effective population size affects the efficacy of selection, rate of evolution by drift and neutral diversity levels. When species are subdivided into multiple populations connected by gene flow, evolutionary processes can depend on global or local effective population sizes. Theory predicts that high levels of diversity might be maintained by gene flow, even very low levels of gene flow, consistent with species long-term effective population size, but tests of this idea are mostly lacking. Here, we show that Lycaeides butterfly populations maintain low contemporary (variance) effective population sizes (e.g. {\textasciitilde}200 individuals) and thus evolve rapidly by genetic drift. However, populations harboured high levels of genetic diversity consistent with an effective population size several orders of magnitude larger. We hypothesized that the differences in the magnitude and variability of contemporary versus long-term effective population sizes were caused by gene flow of sufficient magnitude to maintain diversity but only subtly affect evolution on generational timescales. Consistent with this hypothesis, we detected low but nontrivial gene flow among populations. Furthermore, using short-term population-genomic time-series data, we documented patterns consistent with predictions from this hypothesis, including a weak but detectable excess of evolutionary change in the direction of the mean (migrant gene pool) allele frequencies across populations and consistency in the direction of allele frequency change over time. The documented decoupling of diversity levels and short-term change by drift in Lycaeides has implications for our understanding of contemporary evolution and the maintenance of genetic variation in the wild.},

	abstract = {The Eastern, migratory population of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus), an iconic North American insect, has declined by {\textasciitilde}80\% over the last decade. The monarch’s multi-generational migration between overwintering grounds in central Mexico and the summer breeding grounds in the northern U.S. and southern Canada is celebrated in all three countries and creates shared management responsibilities across North America. Here we present a novel Bayesian multivariate auto-regressive state-space model to assess quasi-extinction risk and aid in the establishment of a target population size for monarch conservation planning. We find that, given a range of plausible quasi-extinction thresholds, the population has a substantial probability of quasi-extinction, from 11–57\% over 20 years, although uncertainty in these estimates is large. Exceptionally high population stochasticity, declining numbers and a small current population size act in concert to drive this risk. An approximately 5-fold increase of the monarch population size (relative to the winter of 2014–15) is necessary to halve the current risk of quasi-extinction across all thresholds considered. Conserving the monarch migration thus requires active management to reverse population declines and the establishment of an ambitious target population size goal to buffer against future environmentally driven variability.},
